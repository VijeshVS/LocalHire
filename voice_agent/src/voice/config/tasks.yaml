extract_info:
  description: >
    Collect accurate user profile details needed to build a meaningful context for further 
    processing. The agent must strictly respond only in {language} language throughout the entire
    conversation. The user may respond in any language, but the agent must always interpret 
    and continue in English. The agent must interrogate the user using the take_user_input tool
    with the 'question' argument to ask and retrieve responses until it confidently obtains:
    1. Full Name
    2. Current Profession/Expertise (OR job user is looking for — whichever applies)
    3. Precise Current Location including:
      - City
      - Approx region / locality / area within that city
      (No vague answers allowed)
    4. Exact Years of Experience in the mentioned profession
    The agent uses the take_user_input tool with the question argument to ask and retrieve responses.
    If any response is unclear, incomplete, or contradictory, the agent must push back and ask 
    clarifying questions before proceeding.
    Do not assume anything — verify everything.
    Once all four data points are verified, end the task by generating the clean JSON object in English only.

find_skill:

    Given a list of skills and a target skill, return all skills from the list that are semantically
    the same occupation or profession. Focus on equivalence, not loose similarity.

    List of skills: {skills}

    Target skill: {skill}

    Do not include any explanations or additional text—only return the list of semantically identical
    skills in JSON format.

location_finder:
  description: >
    Given a fuzzy input of city and region within that city, return the precise latitude
    and longitude coordinates along with the cleaned city and region names.

    The tavily_search tool can be used to look up for right city and region names.
    Tool Arguments of tavily_search: {'query': {'description': 'The search query string.', 'type': 'str'}}   
    Once right city and region names are found, use the same tavily_search tool to get latitude and longitude

    Note: Region is not a state or a country, but a locality/area within the city.

    Fuzzy input: Region: {region}, City: {city}
